Yet, if one so decides, one can explicity build a
list by extracting all the contents out of a source. This operation provides a
bridge to pure list-processing code, by loading all the data to
memory.

Supporting both sources and sinks may appear to be a superficial
advantage, compared to the approach of Kiselyov. However, duality is
fundamental in our work: the existence of both sources and sinks is
based on support for streams with two kinds of polarities: pull
streams and push streams, while Kiselyov's iteratees are heavily
geared towards pull streams.
